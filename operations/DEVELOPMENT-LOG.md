## Final Copy Implementation

### Streamlined Content Flow:
- **Hero**: "Assembled with intention" (softer than "built")
- **About**: Concise "creative house for ventures that matter"
- **Approach**: "We hold what we believe in" (removed parent/child language)
- **Work**: Focus on "emerging labels" (variety from "small brands")
- **Contact**: Branded email subject "Start a conversation — Tuku Group"
- **Footer**: Updated to "© 2025 Tuku Group, LLC"

### Typography & Design:
- **Single font**: JetBrains Mono throughout
- **Ultra-minimal**: Pure text blocks with massive whitespace
- **600px max-width**: Centered, single-column layout
- **Sequential flow**: Each concept in its own section
- **Brand gold accent**: Philosophy headers in #C19A4B for emphasis

---

## Design Implementation

### Typography
- **Headers**: Space Grotesk (fallback for ITC Avant Garde Gothic)
- **Body**: Lekton monospace font
- **Scaling**: Responsive from mobile (16px base) to desktop (18px base)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between hero, section, and body text

### Layout Approach
- **Minimal**: Ultra-clean with abundant whitespace
- **Manifesto-driven**: Each section focuses on single concept
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive grid system
- **Type-forward**: Typography as primary visual element

### Color Usage
- **Black sections**: About and Work (alternating contrast)
- **White sections**: Hero, Philosophy, Engage
- **Gold accent**: Contact links and selection highlights

## Notes

- **LinkedIn integration**: Unable to access profile directly, but site structure supports professional positioning
- **Reference style**: Followed YZY Money minimal manifesto approach
- **Copy tone**: Maintained "quiet authority" without corporate jargon
- **CTA strategy**: Single consistent "Start a conversation" throughout
- **Component isolation**: Split-flap component specific to 01-LANDING-PAGE only, no impact on 02/03 projects
