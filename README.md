# Tuku Group — Creative House Landing Page

## Project Overview

A one-page manifesto website for Tuku Group, the parent company and creative house that operates as both holder of cultural ventures (e.g., OF THE CULTURE) and selective advisor to emerging small labels and early brands.

**Purpose**: Replace conversations about brand specifics with a higher-order reference point communicating Tuku Group's vision, positioning, and invitation to engage.

---

## Design Reference

**Primary Inspiration**: [YZY Money](https://money.yeezy.com) — ultra-minimal, manifesto-driven, type-forward approach

**Key Design Principles from Reference**:
- Stripped-down, conceptual aesthetic
- Function at core while breaking traditional composition rules
- Text-minimal interface with focus on typography
- Bold, declarative statements
- Immersive, art-like experience
- Endless whitespace and breathing room

---

## Brand Ethos

- **Craft over noise** — fewer, better, slower
- **Culture as compass** — rooted in present-tense signals, designed for longevity  
- **Independent by choice** — decentralized thinking, sovereign in approach

**Tone**: Elegant, sophisticated, quietly declarative
